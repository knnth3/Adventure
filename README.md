# Adventure
RPG turn based game
This is a personal project I've been working on since the start of April 2, 2018. 

Adventure is a 3D top down turn based game where friends can play out their hero's stories. 
It's based upon the large Franchise of DnD and influenced by the popular website Roll20. 

With the power of Unreal Engine and Steam's API, maps that are dynamically created by the player's can be played
and shared across the comunity to offer experiences unique to each's stories.

## Features:
- Connect and play with friends using Steam
- Creation of dynamic maps which push the limits of Unreal Engine's potential for optimization
- Interactable play sessions with changing variables such as real time player movement, dynamically triggered events, and features like fog of war
- Fies for such areas that can be shared across the community to allow for different experiences.
- Responsive system that doesn't hinder play experience

## TODO:
- Add item templates to the game wich allow for custom pickups in each session.
- Better design tools to allow for more unique maps
- Attacks still need to replicate over the network
- Maps need to be packed more efficiently to reduce download times and network transfer ammounts
- Thematic UI for gameplay, main menu, and game-builder.
- UI to organize all the available assets by type to allow items to be found more easily
- More models = more possibilities
- Optimization of all features to allow Adventure to run on lower end computers

###### The specs for running Adventure aren't too high as it's been tested on several laptops like Window's Surface but it is recommended to have around an Intel I7 core processor, GTX 960-970, and around 8 gb of ram.
